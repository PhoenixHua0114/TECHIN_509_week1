    "# Sign-Up Validator\n",

    "### Username Validation\n",
    "Write a function `validate_username(username)` that:\n",
    "- Returns False if the username is empty, shorter than 3, or longer than 20 characters.\n",
    "- Returns False if it contains anything besides letters, digits, underscore _, dot ., or hyphen -.\n",

    "- Ensures the domain contains at least one \".\" and doesn’t start/end with \".\".\n",

    "- Removes all non-digit characters.\n",
    "- If the number doesn’t start with \"+\", prepend the default country code.\n",
    "- Check that the final string has between 9 and 15 digits (excluding +).\n",
